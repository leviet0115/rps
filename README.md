# Rps - a web application for displaying Rock Paper Sciccors result

### Sitemap:

1. **Homepage**:     displays live infomation of ongoin games

2. **Player info**:  displays player ifno and game history


### What can be improved:

1. Handle web-socket connection error in a better way. Now, it is programmed to close and reopen the websocket on errors. 

2. Library error from React Material Table: 
Failed prop type: The prop `onChangeRowsPerPage` of `ForwardRef(TablePagination)` is deprecated. Use the `onRowsPerPageChange` prop instead.
